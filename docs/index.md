## About Me

Hi, my name's Sebastien.

Following a burnout, I am currently learning how to refactor myself because of the the "Spoon Theory" (autism spectrum disorder).

Presently, I love **Java** and **C#** programming, building images with **Docker** and running on **Kubernetes**.

My favorites practices are :
* **Test-Driven Develoment (TDD)** to validate **Proof-Of-Value** experiments and other prototypes,
* But above all my preference goes towards **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** patterns in order to capture features and organize **architecture components**.

I prefer to focus more on product roadmap than project management. That's why I always try to do my best with **agile methodology**, like **Scrum** for pure development stuff or **Kanban** for ops tasks.

I'm really sorry for my English speech because it's a well-known fact French people re awful when they speak another language than theirs :)

I am most skilled in :
* `Azure` & `OpenStack` Cloud providers,
* `Docker` & `Kubernetes` (I code my own controllers) container-based solutions,
* And last but not least, `Jakarta EE` and [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io) frameworks. [Apache TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) are my two favorites runtimes because of their simplicity (I love **KISS** solutions, not only the hard-rock band :)).
* More recently, I (re)discovered the power of C# and more specifically [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture) ecosystem for **Microservices**.
