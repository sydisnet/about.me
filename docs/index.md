## About Me

Hi, my name's Sebastien.

Following a burnout, I am currently learning how to refactor myself because of the "Spoon Theory" (autism spectrum disorder).

Presently, I love **Java** and **C#** programming, building images with **Docker** and running them on **Kubernetes**.

My favorites practices are :
* **Test-Driven Develoment (TDD)** to validate **Proof-Of-Value** experiments and other prototypes,
* But above all my preference goes towards **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** patterns in order to capture features and organize **architecture components**.

I prefer to focus more on product roadmap than project management. That's why I always try to do my best with **agile methodology**, like **Scrum** for pure development stuff or **Kanban** for ops tasks.

I'm really sorry for my English speech. As you certainly know, it's a well-known fact French people are awful when they speak another language than theirs :)

I am most skilled in :
* **Cloud providers:** [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/azure) & [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/),
* **Container-based solutions:** [Docker](https://mobyproject.org/) ecosystem whose [Swarm Mode](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit) but also more sophisticated alternatives like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) (I code my own controllers), in particular [k3s from Rancher](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) and [k0s from Mirantis](https://k0sproject.io/),
* And last but not least, [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/) and [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io) frameworks. [Apache TomEE](https://tomee.apache.org/) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) are my two favorites runtimes because of their simplicity: I prefer these **KISS** solutions to more complicated ones :)
* More recently, I (re)discovered the power of **C#** and more specifically [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture) ecosystem for **Microservices**.

#### Maths, maths and maths

| School or University                                         | Degree                                | Period    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |-------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Université du Littoral Côte d'Opale<br/>Calais, France       | Bachelor's degree in Maths            | 1997-2000 |

During these years, I decided to focus myself on maths studies rather than IT stuff. The reason for this is that I was afraid to do a job in relation to my hobby.

#### When I was a child...

...I first programmed at the age of 11. After that, this hobby never left me.


### A Little More About Me

My other narrow interests are about :
* Whisk(e)y and its history,
* Cyberpunk-oriented films and games,
* Metal and atmospheric symphonic music.
